# 👨‍💻 Python Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a Python Developer passionate about building solutions that automate tasks, optimize workflows, and bring ideas to life through code.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently working in the **Customer Operations** area at **Enel X**, where I apply Python to develop automation tools that improve daily business processes. My experience includes:

- Automating Excel and CSV data workflows
- Working with APIs to integrate different systems
- Developing scripts for reporting and reconciliation
- Creating end-to-end automation for monthly tasks

I'm currently expanding my skill set with **Django**, **Django REST Framework**, and **Flask**, aiming to build scalable web applications and RESTful APIs.
